Description:

This is a small app that allows users to interact with it. Users can choose a category from a dropdown menu, enter the cost in an input field, and upon submission, they will see a card with the category title and input value as the price. They can edit or delete their expenses, and after five expenses, pagination will be applied to the list.

There is also another page where users can view a list of expenses. We calculate all expenses with the same category and display the total expenses for each user. Users can sort the list by price from higher to lower or by alphabetical order.

The app is connected to Firebase and hosted there. On the first page, we also have a registration and login form for every user.
